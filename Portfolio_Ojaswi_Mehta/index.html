                In 2022-23, I was a core member of SAE-VIT, actively
                participating in various events, both offline and online. This
                involvement significantly expanded my knowledge of the
                automotive industry. As a core member, I also acquired
                additional skills such as design and video editing. These
                experiences not only enriched my understanding of automotive
                engineering but also equipped me with versatile abilities
                essential for professional growth.

                In 2022-23, I participated in Robovitics, where introductory
                sessions covered basic knowledge of several software tools,
                including Fusion 360 for mechanical design and Figma for
                graphical design. Additionally, I gained exposure to backend and
                frontend web development, along with app development skills.
                Focusing on web development, I honed my abilities and crafted
                several websites, furthering my expertise in this domain.

              numerous college students to campus for a myriad of competitions
              like hackathons, ideathons, robowars and IDRL. During the event,
              SAE organized a workshop named AERO-Crafters, in partnership with
              our student team, "Assailing Falcons," of which I served as the
              point of contact. My duties encompassed ensuring seamless
              coordination between the team and organizers, overseeing
              activities from procurement to execution.
